<p>Early in the morning today, while I was scrolling through my Facebook page, I came across this post condemning an content about “The Modern Girl”. Though it did not interest me initially, but grabbed my attention as it started going viral on the internet and popped up every time I scrolled through my social media accounts.<br> 

To placate my nosiness, I tried hard to get a copy and finally, I could read the entire essay authored by apparently, a well-qualified woman. As I saw her qualifications on the cover page, I settled that it must be the “disapprobation of opinion” doing the rounds and there may not be any such thing actually, to create mayhem, until I read the contents word by word once, twice and yet again many times.<br>

According to the content, if you are a girl/woman and consider yourself a modern one, then you are “smart, intelligent and fashionable. You love to wear jeans and hot pants, and sarees have no place in your stock of garments. You are not shy and are not ready to confine yourself within the four walls of your home. Not only this, you are concerned about your health and figure and want to keep yourself fit. You are a self-centered creature and your parents are partly responsible for what you are, since according to the essay, you were not guided enough during the formation yeas. Not only this, you are not any less than men regardless of your financial status.<br></p>
