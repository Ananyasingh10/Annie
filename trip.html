<p1 style="color:red">It is often said that good things come in small packages. And while I say that, a place that instantly strikes my mind is the beautiful land of Sikkim. Small in size but big in offerings, the state of Sikkim is one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. Located remotely in the arms of the Himalayas, it is a landlocked state with China, Bhutan and Nepal as its borders. The state of Sikkim, which was a monarchy until 1975, is a new addition in the federal union of India.<br>
