<p1>My family consists of me, my father and my mother. I am their only child and am extremely loved and pampered. I love my family and am thankful to them for helping and supporting me in whatever I do. Every child has certain dreams and aspirations. However, not everyone is lucky to get the support of his/ her family to attain them. I am one of those few lucky ones who have got complete support from my family in this regard.<br></p1>

<p2 style="background-color:tomato;">My Parents Supported Me to Follow My Passion<br>

I have always been a great fan of Madhuri Dixit although she is from an era when I was not even born. I grew fond of her when I saw her performance in the movie, Aaja Nachle. I became a huge fan of her dance moves. It was then that I searched for all her songs online and watched her dance. I tried to copy her dance moves but could not. She inspired me to dance and I immediately knew that this is my calling in life.<br>

I was in sixth standard at that time and I spoke to my mother about my newly found passion. I also told her that I wanted to learn dance from a professional dance school. I had joined drawing and swimming classes during my primary classes. However, since I had been promoted to sixth standard and had to take tuitions for mathematics and physics I had no time left for such hobby classes, so I withdrawn from these classes.<br>

My parents wanted me to concentrate on my studies as this was the time to build a strong base. However, my mother agreed to enroll me at a professional dance school looking at my keen interest in it. I promised her that I will study dedicatedly and wouldn’t let this hamper my performance in school. My father also supported in my decision.<br>

My Family Made Me a Confident Person<br>

It has been 4 years now and I have been continuing with my dance classes. I am now in class tenth and have my boards this year. My parents suggested me to discontinue the dance class this year however they did not insist and asked me to take the decision on my own. This is what I love the most about my family. Nothing is forced upon me. They treat me like a mature person and this has actually made me wiser and mature.<br>

It has enhanced my decision making ability. Slowly and steadily, I have developed the ability to analyze what is good for me and take decisions based on it. This has boosted my confidence and helped me so far and will certainly help me in future. This has only been possible because of the love and support of my parents. If they had objected to my decision, I would not have evolved so well in various aspects in life. Dance has given meaning to my life.<br>

Conclusion<br>

I love my family for standing by my side, loving me unconditionally and being my support system. I am lucky to have such a loving and understanding family.<br>
